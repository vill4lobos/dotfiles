# .files

Compilation of some configuration files of a few softwares that I use.

Soon I'll post some screenshots of how they look together.

## What's happening here?

This repo and these files could be interesting for anyone that likes tiling windows managers, Vim and music in general.

## Possible future files

- Refactored (or not) old scripts
- New scripts
- Organized different dev environments
- .ahk and misc. utils from Windows env
